        <p>I have had a love of computers since the days of playing barely
        functioning games on the family windows 95' computer. Video games in
        particular have always been a favorite hobby of mine. In High school
        I took classes in video editing and stop-motion animation using a laptop
        I bought and the school's camera. My time in these classes would eventually
        lead me to decide that I wanted to do that kind of work professionally.</p>
        
    
        <p>I attended Savannah College of Art and Design to study animation, but
        eventually changed my major to interactive design and game development. My
        time in game design was my first real step into the world of how computers 
        worked, although at the time I was still more focused on the artistry rather 
        than the construction. I graduated with a BFA in 2013 but chose to persue other 
        interests in the years after.</p>
    
        <p>During my time in school I took some basic classes on web development
        and programming, but never took it any further than that. In the years since
        then my interest in expanding my understanding of coding has grown and now
        I seek to code professionally. I am looking forward to developing my skills 
        in the months ahead.</p>
