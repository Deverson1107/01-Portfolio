        <p>I have had a love of computers since the days of playing barely
        functioning games on the family windows 95' computer. Eventually I would
        dabble in video editing and animation after getting my own laptop in highschool.</p>

        <p>I attended Savannah College of Art and Design to study animation, but
        eventually changed my major to interactive design and game development.
        I graduated with a BFA in 2013 but did not persue a career in the game
        industry.</p>

        <p>During my time in school I took some basic classes on web development
        and programming, and now I seek to expand my understanding of these skills
        to hopefully make a career out of it in the days ahead.</p>
